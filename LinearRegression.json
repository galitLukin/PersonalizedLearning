To do this, first read the dataset climate_change.csv into R. Then, split the data into a training set, consisting of all the observations up to and including 2006, and a testing set consisting of the remaining years (hint: use subset). A training set refers to the data that will be used to build the model (this is the data we give to the lm() function), and a testing set refers to the data we will use to test our predictive ability. Next, build a linear regression model to predict the dependent variable Temp, using MEI, CO2, CH4, N2O, CFC.11, CFC.12, TSI, and Aerosols as independent variables (Year and Month should NOT be used in the model). Use the training set to build the model. What is the model R-squared (the \"Multiple R-squared\" value):",

We have observed that, for this problem, when we remove many variables the sign of N2O flips. The model has not lost a lot of explanatory power (the model R2 is 0.7261 compared to 0.7509 previously) despite removing many variables. As discussed in lecture, this type of behavior is typical when building a model where many of the independent variables are highly correlated with each other.

          "text": "We have many variables in this problem, and as we have seen above, dropping some from the model does not decrease model quality. R provides a function, step, that will automate the procedure of trying different combinations of variables to find a good compromise of model simplicity and R2. This trade-off is formalized by the Akaike information criterion (AIC) - it can be informally thought of as the quality of the model with a penalty for the number of variables in the model. The step function has one argument - the name of the initial model. It returns a simplified model. Use the step function in R to derive a new model, with the full model as the initial model (HINT: If your initial full model was called \"climateLM\", you could create a new model with the step function by typing step(climateLM). Be sure to save your new model to a variable name so that you can look at the summary. For more information about the step function, type ?step in your R console.)

If you look at the summary of the model with summary(StepModel) and only CH4 was removed. It is interesting to note that the step function does not address the collinearity of the variables, except that adding highly correlated variables will not improve the R2 significantly. The consequence of this is that the step function will not necessarily produce a very interpretable model - just a model that has balanced quality and simplicity for a particular weighting of quality and simplicity (AIC).",
