The step function has one argument - the name of the initial model. It returns a simplified model. Use the step function in R to derive a new model, with the full model as the initial model (HINT: If your initial full model was called \"climateLM\", you could create a new model with the step function by typing step(climateLM).

However, by default R selects the first level alphabetically (\"American Indian/Alaska Native\") as the reference level of our factor instead of the most common level (\"White\"). Set the reference level of the factor by typing the following two lines in your R console: pisaTrain$raceeth = relevel(pisaTrain$raceeth, \"White\") pisaTest$raceeth = relevel(pisaTest$raceeth, \"White\") Now, build a linear regression model (call it lmScore) using the training set to predict readingScore using all the remaining variables. It would be time-consuming to type all the variables, but R provides the shorthand notation \"readingScore ~ .\" to mean \"predict readingScore using all the other variables in the data frame.\" The period is used to replace listing out all of the independent variables. As an example, if your dependent variable is called \"Y\", your independent variables are called \"X1\", \"X2\", and \"X3\", and your training data set is called \"Train\", instead of the regular notation: LinReg = lm(Y ~ X1 + X2 + X3, data = Train) You would use the following command to build your model: LinReg = lm(Y ~ ., data = Train) What is the Multiple R-squared value of lmScore on the training set? Note that this R-squared is lower than the ones for the models we saw in the lectures and recitation. This does not necessarily imply that the model is of poor quality. More often than not, it simply means that the prediction problem at hand (predicting a student's test score based on demographic and school-related variables) is more difficult than other prediction problems (like predicting a team's number of wins from their runs scored and allowed, or predicting the quality of wine from weather conditions).",

We are instead interested in obtaining predictions of the ILI value. We can convert from predictions of log(ILI) to predictions of ILI via exponentiation, or the exp() function. The new code, which predicts the ILI value, is PredTest1 = exp(predict(FluTrend1, newdata=FluTest)) What is our estimate for the percentage of ILI-related physician visits for the week of March 11, 2012?
